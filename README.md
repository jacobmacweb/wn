# wn

wn is a version control system, inspired by git, created as an experiment for myself.

wn stands for "why not", as in "why not make another version control system"?

## Goals

_v0.1_

- [ ] Create a repository through wn
- [ ] Add file contents to a staging area
- [ ] Commit files
- [ ] Store compressed files from commit
- [ ] Link to previous versions for unchanged files
- [ ] Create branches
  - [ ] Allow detached HEAD
- [ ] Revert commits
- [ ] Merge branches
  - [ ] Squishing
  - [ ] Zip merge (all commits from branch B are filed into branch A)
- [ ] Track wn through itself

_v0.2_

- [ ] Compress repository into a smaller file (with deltas) to send to a server
- [ ] Simple server to accept changes
